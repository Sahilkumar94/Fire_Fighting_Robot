Problem Statement: To make a robot that detects the fire and extinguish it by itself

Description: Nowadays, it is an essential safety measure for large scale buildings to be equipped with a Fire Safety Sprinkler System. As far as small structures such as houses, shops are not well equipped and are always at a risk of Fire Hazard. For this problem, built a smart robot that can be used for any fire incident at any particular area. The Robot should navigate automatically to the area of fire and use necessary measures to eradicte it.

Components Used :
1. Arduino UNO
2. Flame sensor
3. Servo motor
4. L298N motor module
5. L293D driver module
6. Mini DC submersible pump
7. Small breadboard
8. Robot chassis with motors and wheels
9. Conneting wires

Our robot is capable of autonuomous searching, detecting and extinguishing the fire outbreak and can move around pto 360 degrees.

Conclusion:
 Through  we can conclude that a robot can be used in place of humans without risk of human
 beings life as well as life of the fire fighters. We can use this robot in our homes, labs, offices etc.
 This robot will provide us greater efficiency to detect the flame and it can be extinguish before 
 it become uncontrollable and threat to life .Hence, this robot will be very helpful and can play
 a important role.
